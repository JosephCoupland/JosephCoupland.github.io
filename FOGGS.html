							<p>University Project | C++ | OpenGL</p>
							<h2>About this project</h2>
							<p>
							This porject is to create a grahpical scene or game using C++ and OpenGL. Orignally the project started with drawing a line onto a screen and later developed to drawing a cube, drawing a cube from a text file and towards the end of the project via OBJs. The project is not currently completed and still needs further developing including having an mtl reader to provide textures to the obj loaded textures. The scene also needs more elements to make it feel grounded such as having a skybox and other objects and a moveable character for the camera to follow.<p>
							<h2>Developed</h2>
							<p>
							This project has helped me understand the graphical pipeline, including lighting effects, more as well as knowledge on linked lists and binary trees. The obj loader allowed me to further my knowledge gained in the past year from creating my hiscores table to instead read in the elements of the obj.</p>

							<h2>Review</h2>
							<p>Overall I'm happy with the currently development of the project, graphics is an area that I can still develop a lot further in and I have learned a lot in this short time. I am happy that I have been able to create a scene and having some user input but I'd like to develop it further to have addtional gameplay elements such as having a player pick up items and complete a small goal.
