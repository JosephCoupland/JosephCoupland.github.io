								<h2><a href="#">Samurai Siege</a></h2>
								<p>
									Developed in Unreal Engine using C++ with Blueprints for animations and effects as a part of my Level 6 Course Work </br>
									</br>
									Grab your friends, and harness the power of 8 weapons through 3 different game modes, free for all, Team Death Match, and Siege.

									<h3>Development</h3>
								</header>
								<h4>Challenges</h4>
								<p>
									When working on university projects I try and assign myself challenges to cover different genres and experiement with different gameplay elements.
									<li>Multiplayer Networked - I had to learn how to use the Steam Online Subsystem.</li>
									<li>Roles & RPCs- I learnt how the engine checks authority to ensure RPCs were called correctly to prevent cheating and correct use of bandwith.</li>
									<li>Ray Tracing and Projectiles - Different weapons use different systems to damage players.</li>
									<li>juiciness - Developed Animation and effects to improve how the game feels and provides feedback to the player .</li>
								</p>
								<p><h4>Organisation</h4>
									Every project I work on I use applications to help me ensure the project is sucessful: </br>
									<li>I use Trello to keep a high level development plan of the project denoting current development stages of tasks, such as needs development, merging, testing or completed.</li>
											<li>Gantt charts are used in order to have an exhausted list of tasks, the dates the tasks should have development started, completed and their current status. By assigning priorities I can use MoSCoW to filter and ensure I have the MVP and work my way through optional features.</li>
											<li>Outlook Calendar is very useful as someone that works part time, I am able to dedicate allotted time on different tasks including social events so I can maintain a health work/study life balance.</li>

									<h3>Review and Lessons Learned</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									After completing projects I like to reflect on what went well and what did not, this helps me learn from each project and improve each time.</br>
									This project benefitted from previous lessons learnt, as I tried to focus elements together and scope the project well from the start. </br>
									This enabled me to spend time during development including cosmetic aspects whilst developing the respective system, whilst I normally would do these at the end, I found this method saved time as I was more familiar with the system due to currently developing it. </br>
									This method also improved enjoyment for play testers, which I found was useful in having improved engagement with play testers wanting to test for longer and offering additional sessions. </br>
									I also learnt methods of testing and debugging within the engine which will help debugging future projects.
