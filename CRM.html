							<h2>About this Job</h2>
							<p>
							In my job, I work as a developer mostly focused on developing a Customer Relationship Management (CRM), Verint/Lagan.<br/>
							This job requires me to develop scripts and forms that customers both internal and external will use to complete enquiries and applications.<br/>
							The systems developed must meet the needs and requirements of service and individuals. The job involves:
							<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
							  <li>Communicating with Stakeholders</li>
							  <li>Quality Assurance (see below)</li>
							  <li>Creating and Completing Testing Plans</li>
							  <li>User Acceptance Testing</li>
							  <li>Delivering System Training</li>
							  <li>Peer Reviewing</li>
							  <li>Refactoring Code</li>
							  <li>System Support</li>
							  <li>Out of Hours Support</li>
							  <li>Reviewing Services</li>
							  <li>Automating processes</li>
							  <li>Reviewing Impact of Developments Made</li>
							  <li>Communicating Changes to Colleagues and Customers</li>
							  <li>Working Underpressure to meet Tight Deadlines</li>
							</ul>
							<br/>
							<h3>Quality Assurance</h3>
							<p>
							A major aspect of my role is to conduct excellent Quality Assurance to ensure there is no disruption to services. <br/>
							<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
							  <li>Create Testing Plans for Colleagues to complete, including each possible route and error validation for incorrect inputs</li>
							  <li>Smoke Testing - (Follows the Visio Process map to ensure at least 1 route works from start to finish to allow further in depth testing, also performed when migrating to other environments)</li>
							  <li>Black Box Testing - (Testing conducted without viewing the code and integrations and simply review if the process requirements and specifications are being met</li>
							  <li>White Box Testing - (Reviewing the code to check if there are any issues that would cause code not to be executed, useful for switch statements)</li>
							  <li>User Acceptance Testing - (Service users test the system to ensure it meets their requirements and is easy to understand and complete required actions)</li>
							  <li>Regression Testing - (Ensure that new changes to our imported JavaScript does not impact existing code)</li>
							  <li>Sanity Testing - (Ensuring bug fixes have not caused any unexpected results)</li>
							</ul>
							<br/>
							My job requires me to constantly update my knowledge on the processes of the services that I work with and share and use new best practices and design changes that the team has agreed upon<br/>
							Communication is an extremely important part of this role, ensuring that new information is distributed to the relevant parties to ensure that the team are not duplicating or losing work as our projects have short deadlines which are often replacing other systems or is when a service is going live and have already communicated the date.<br/><br/><p>
							<h2>Developed</h2>
							<p>
							I joined the team a year into the development of the system and was able to provide a fresh perspective on how the team was developing some processes and I was able to make some efficiency changes to the coding practices that the team had whilst picking up how the team worked and information of services. I believe that looking at the reports that we provide services, the CRM was a huge improvement over the previous system that the organisation used, this was achieved by involving stakeholders throughout the project, providing updates and Visio maps for services, having workshops with services and customers to ensure that the requirements of the service would be met and everything that the system could previously provide was still available with improvements to ensure that the service only was improved.</p>

							<h2>Review</h2>
							<p>I am proud of the work of the CRM that we have developed, the system meets services needs and we often hear positive feedback from customers and customers often recommend that other services and teams start using the CRM<br/>
