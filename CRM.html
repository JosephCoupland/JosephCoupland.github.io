							<h2>About this project</h2>
							<p>
							In my job, I work as a developer mostly focused on developing a Customer Relationship Management (CRM), Verint/Lagan.<br/>
							This job requires me to develop scripts and forms that customers both internal and external will use to complete enquiries and applications.<br/>
							The systems developed must meet the needs and requirements of service and individuals. The job involves:
							<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
							  <li>Communicating with Stakeholders</li>
							  <li>Quality Assurance</li>
							  <li>Creating and Completing Testing Plans</li>
							  <li>User Acceptance Testing</li>
							  <li>Delivering System Training</li>
							  <li>Peer Reviewing</li>
							  <li>Refactoring Code</li>
							  <li>System Support</li>
							  <li>Out of Hours Support</li>
							  <li>Reviewing Services</li>
							  <li>Automating processes</li>
							  <li>Reviewing Impact of Developments Made</li>
							  <li>Communicating Changes to Colleagues and Customers</li>
							  <li>Working Underpressure to meet Tight Deadlines</li>
							</ul>
							<br/>
							My job requires me to constantly update my knowledge on the processes of the services that I work with and share and use new best practices and design changes that the team has agreed upon<br/>
							Communication is an extremely important part of this role, ensuring that new information is distributed to the relevant parties to ensure that the team are not duplicating or losing work as our projects have short deadlines which are often replacing other systems or is when a service is going live and have already communicated the date.<br/><br/><p>
							<h2>Developed</h2>
							<p>
							I joined the team a year into the development of the system and was able to provide a fresh perspective on how the team was developing some processes and I was able to make some efficiency changes to the coding practices that the team had whilst picking up how the team worked and information of services. I believe that looking at the reports that we provide services, the CRM was a huge improvement over the previous system that the organisation used, this was achieved by involving stakeholders throughout the project, providing updates and Visio maps for services, having workshops with services and customers to ensure that the requirements of the service would be met and everything that the system could previously provide was still available with improvements to ensure that the service only was improved.</p>

							<h2>Review</h2>
							<p>I am proud of the work of the CRM that we have developed, the system meets services needs and we often hear positive feedback from customers and customers often recommend that other services and teams start using the CRM<br/>
