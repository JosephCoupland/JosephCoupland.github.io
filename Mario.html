							<h1 class="major">Mario SDL Project</h1>
							<p>University Project | C++ | SDL | Marked 90/100</p>
							<h2>About this project</h2>
							<p>
							
							This project is to create a game similar to Mario using C++ and OpenGL. The project started with me rendering a placeholder background image which would hold the scene within the game level. Over time I rendered characters to the screen, gave them controls and also created a tile map that the characters could interact with. The project was developed to include enemies and audio as well as a playable Luigi. </br>
							The project has areas for development such as including multiple levels, collectables, powerups, saving and loading.<p>
							<h2>Developed</h2>
							<p>
							This project has helped me understand the use of having additional libraries such as SDL and made me appreciate classes and inheritance, and has also improved my debugging</p>

							<h2>Review</h2>
							<p>Overall I'm happy with the current development of the project, there are still a large number of changes that I'd like to implement to the project during my personal time to help further develop the project and develop my skills. I achieved a very high first for this assignment.<br/>
							<br/>
							Link to Trello document coming soon.</p>
