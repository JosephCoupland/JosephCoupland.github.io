								<h2><a href="#">Murder Mystery</a></h2>
								<p>
									Developed in Unity using C# as a part of my Level 5 Course Work </br>
									</br>
									Immerse yourself in a suspense-laden evening where every conversation hides a motive and every room holds a secret. As the delicate threads of a dinner party unravel, you must navigate whispered confessions, cryptic clues, and subtle betrayals to unveil the truth before the night's end â€“ because the apartment's walls can talk, and they're telling a chilling tale of mystery.
								</p>

							<p>
								The game takes place in an apartment where a dinner party has almost taken the hosts life. The player must talk to guests to discover motives and explore the apartment for clues.

									<h3>Development</h3>
								</header>
								<h4>Challenges</h4>
								<p>
									When working on university projects I try and assign myself challenges to cover different genres and experiement with different gameplay elements.
									<li>Dialogue - I created a dialogue system which could have multiple characters talking, show different photos for their emotions.</li>
									<li>Story Triggers - I created multiple ways for the player to progress the story, from finding clues to speaking to required suspects.</li>
									<li>Inventory system - I created a basic inventory system which the player could collect clues to help with their investigation, items could be found or given via talking to npcs.</li>
									<li>Hints - I created tutorial aspects in the dialogue and also hints in the inventory when opened or by clicking on missing items.</li>
									<li>Dialogue - </li>
								</p>
								<p><h4>Organisation</h4>
									Every project I work on I use applications to help me ensure the project is sucessful: </br>
									<li>I use Trello to keep a high level development plan of the project denoting current development stages of tasks, such as needs development, merging, testing or completed.</li>
											<li>Gantt charts are used in order to have an exhausted list of tasks, the dates the tasks should have development started, completed and their current status. By assigning priorities I can use MoSCoW to filter and ensure I have the MVP and work my way through optional features.</li>
											<li>Outlook Calendar is very useful as someone that works part time, I am able to dedicate allotted time on different tasks including social events so I can maintain a health work/study life balance.</li>

									<h3>Review and Lessons Learned</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									After completing projects I like to reflect on what went well and what did not, this helps me learn from each project and improve each time.</br>
									Consider what is needed and if it is worth creating a more bespoke system if it is not nessasairy for the project, I orginally though of a really interesting inventory system which the player could use and considered how it could work and its interactions but later realised during my planning of drawing ideas and process mapping, that the system was overly complicated for the genre and what the player would be using the inventory for. It is important early in development to consider why something is being developed and if it is overcomplicated for the task it needs to perform.</br>
									When working on a project using free online assets, always ensure that each asset works perfectly for what you are trying to achieve and do not test just a few. During this project I used multiple free assets, including characters. The characters I used I was able to easy animate the first two characters with some animations I found online, as they worked I found and tested different animations on those characters, and used character portraits for dialogue. I later discovered that the other models had issues with animations which I could have discovered sooner if I tested all of them rather than 1/3rd which felt like enough at the time.</br>
